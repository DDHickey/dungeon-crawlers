A simple ASCII C++ game developed for a national competition. 

I have included the legend for the game inside the code to make it easier for readablility. I have created this ASCII game for a nationals competition.
Additionally, the desired skills practiced inside the code are illustrated through:

* Reading an external file.
* Parsing the data from the file, which contains the length and width as well as map layout.
* Controlling the movement of the ASCII characters by utilizing 2D-Arrays to emulate a cartesian graph coordinate system.
* Monitoring player score and health.
* Switching between files programmatically rather through user input.

\* Finally I would like to mention that this by no means is the perfect code for the project but my initial observation for the direction of the code.
